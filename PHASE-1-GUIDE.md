### Example 2: Identifying Issues

**Scenario: Low Profitability**

**Metrics Show:**

**Action Items:**
1. Improve creative to boost CTR
2. Optimize listing (images, copy, reviews)
3. Test price points
4. Refine targeting to reduce CPC

### Example 3: Growth Opportunities

**Scenario: Profitable but Want to Scale**

**Metrics Show:**
